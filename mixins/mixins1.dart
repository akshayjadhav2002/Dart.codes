//mixins are by default abstract
//we can not create the object of abstract class hence we can not create the object of mixin
//we can not create the constructor of mixin explicitly it is implicitly declared and hidded from us we an not access it . 
//mixin is created when ever it is need if we created every class as mixin class then it would be harder to compile and run the prog.
